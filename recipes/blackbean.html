    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>With only 5 ingredients, these black bean tostadas are the easiest and fastest meal to throw together. You can
        always
        include additional toppings like corn salsa, avocado ranch, or endless crunchy veggies like radishes or pickled
        red
        onions, but these are also delicious if you keep things simple, like we did here.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>2 (15-oz.) cans black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
    <li>8 tostadas</li>
    <li>2 c. shredded pepper jack</li>
    <li>Avocado, sliced</li>
    <li>Hot sauce</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°. In a small saucepan over medium heat, add beans and 1 cup of water. Bring to a simmer
            and let
            simmer until beans are warmed through, about 10 minutes. Smash with a wooden spoon until most of the beans
            are smashed
            with some whole remaining. Add more water as needed to help create a smoother consistency.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place tostadas on a large baking sheet and sprinkle cheese evenly over each. Bake until cheese is
            melty,
            about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Top tostadas with beans, avocado slices, and hot sauce.
        </li>
    </ol>
